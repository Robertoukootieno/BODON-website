    comment: 'We booked the 4-day Maasai Mara safari in September and witnessed the Great Migration firsthand. Our guide, Peter, was exceptional - he knew exactly where to find the wildlife and shared incredible insights about the ecosystem. We saw lions, elephants, giraffes, and even a leopard! The tented camp was comfortable and the food was delicious. This was the trip of a lifetime!',

    comment: 'At 52, I wasn\'t sure I could summit Mount Kenya, but the Bodon team made it possible. The guides were patient, the acclimatization schedule was perfect, and reaching Point Lenana at sunrise was absolutely magical. I could see Kilimanjaro in the distance. The porters were incredibly helpful and the whole experience was well-organized. Highly recommend for anyone considering this adventure!',

    comment: 'We spent 5 days combining Diani Beach with cultural experiences. The Swahili village visit was eye-opening - we learned about traditional crafts and had lunch with a local family. The beaches were pristine and the snorkeling was fantastic. Our guide, Amina, was knowledgeable and made us feel welcome everywhere. The blend of relaxation and cultural immersion was perfect. We\'re already planning our next trip!',

    comment: 'I rented a Toyota Voxy for a week to explore Kenya with my family. The car was immaculate, fuel-efficient, and perfect for navigating both city streets and rough terrain. The 24/7 support team was responsive when I had questions. The pickup at JKIA was seamless and the staff explained everything clearly. Best car rental experience I\'ve had in Africa. Will definitely use Bodon again!',

    comment: 'The Amboseli Elephant Safari was incredible! We saw massive herds of elephants with Mount Kilimanjaro as the backdrop. The photography opportunities were endless. Our guide knew the elephants by name and shared fascinating facts about their behavior. The lodge was comfortable and the sunset game drives were magical. This experience changed my perspective on wildlife conservation.',

    comment: 'The Samburu Cultural Experience was transformative. We spent 4 days with the Samburu community, learning about their traditions, participating in ceremonies, and understanding their connection to the land. The guides were respectful and the interactions felt authentic, not touristy. We also saw unique wildlife like the reticulated giraffe. This was more than a tour - it was a cultural exchange that we\'ll never forget.',
